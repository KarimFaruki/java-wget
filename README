This is a dead simple wget.

It's super simple and only uses standard java classes.

Just a super simple utility.  I'm using it to download some source 
files for another project so I thought I'd just put it up here in
github land so someone can try and use it.

This has no license because it's like licensing a for loop - dead
simple stuff but a nice lesson for the java newbie

This should work with any ole jdk because it uses dead simple classes too.

To use:
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Wget.wGet("thefile.zip", "http://example.com/downloads/thefile.zip");
  }

I only wrote this because I found myself using the http client library by 
apache commons and the did some injection stuff and was just overdoing 
all that java enterprise stuff when it's just for a simple indexer.

That's what happens when you code late night.
